This is a simple script for use on a Raspberry Pi to drive my mini cocktail maker. That maker drives a bunch of
  `INTLLAB 12V DC DIY Peristaltic Liquid Pump Dosing Pumps`
using a
  `Kootek 8 Channel DC 5V Relay Module`
hooked up to the GPIO pins. The screen is the standard
  `Pi Foundation Display - 7" Touchscreen Display`
but other touchscreens should probably work. (I had to muck about a little to make Kivy play nice with that screen if I recall.)
